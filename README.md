**Boostspace** is a unique solution designed specifically for our small online store. The application provides a convenient and intuitive interface for working with data from private Google spreadsheets. Users are given the ability to search, sort, create their own filters, and divide the overall table into salary periods. There is no longer a need to manually calculate the number of orders and salary; simply set the necessary filters, and Boostspace will handle all the work, providing the necessary information.

Due to the use of private data, access to the application is restricted, and registration is done through an invitation code. The ability to create invitation codes is available only to me and the administrator.

The application is built on the technologies of Vue 3, VueX, Express, PostgresQS, and Sequelize. By leveraging Vue 3 and VueX, the application benefits from a scalable and reactive user interface, allowing for seamless data handling and real-time updates. Express serves as the backend framework, providing a solid foundation for building RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic. The integration of PostgresQS and Sequelize enables efficient and intuitive database operations, ensuring smooth data management within the application.
